# GraphQL Pokemon
Simple implementation of a ReactNative app consuming an GraphQL API. The project uses a Pokemon Data API (https://pokeapi.co/) to generate the data used on the app. Remember to run the project online!

## Inpired by
`GETTING STARTED WITH GRAPHQL IN REACT NATIVE` article published by Wern Ancheta on Pusher.com at June 23rd, 2019. The original article can be found here: https://pusher.com/tutorials/learning-graphql-react-native

## What's different from the original?
The app built at the article uses older versions of NodeJs and ReactNative, so I upgraded the project to run in newer releases. The versions I'll be using are the following:
* Node 14.11.0
* Yarn 1.22.5
* React Native CLI 2.0.1
* React Native 0.63.2

Hope you enjoy it!
